# go-auth-api-demo

Golang authentication implementation with JWT and Gin framework demonstration, reutilized from my another repository.
Made a simple and flexible scheme with atomics abstraction + clean archicture and made a simple error handling scheme.

Setup `.env` with `.env.example` and give a try:

```sh
$ make run
```
